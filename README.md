# Projects

I always have a new idea, below you'll find some of the project I'm currently working on.

I'm currently doing a lot with Javascript/Node.JS as I personally really enjoy dynamic typing.
Started my programming journey on Java where that's not possible.

All personal projects are designed to be run inside containers with docker and connected through websockets.
Dividing the projects into nodes and cores.

Core:
- Empurion.net

The core is the glue that connects the applications to the system and database.

Software:
- Matrix
- Docker
- Discord
- Email
- [Syslog](https://github.com/Empurion/Syslog)
- React - Portfolio
- React - Administrator Dashboard
